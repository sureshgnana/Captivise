Overview
--------

The mod_wsgi package provides an Apache module that implements a WSGI
compliant interface for hosting Python based web applications on top of the
Apache web server.

The primary package for mod_wsgi is available on the Python package index
(PyPi) as ``mod_wsgi``. That package assumes that you have a suitable
version of Apache pre-installed on your target system, and if you don't,
installation of the package will fail.

If you are on a UNIX like system (Linux, macOS) and need a version of
Apache to be installed for you, you can use the ``mod_wsgi-standalone``
package on PyPi instead. When installing the ``mod_wsgi-standalone``
package it will first trigger the installation of the ``mod_wsgi-httpd``
package, which will result in a version of Apache being installed as
part of your Python installation. Next the ``mod_wsgi`` package will be
installed, with it using the version of Apache installed by the
``mod_wsgi-httpd`` package rather than any system package for Apache.

Note that this method of installation is only suitable for where you want
to use ``mod_wsgi-express``. It cannot be used to build mod_wsgi for use
with your system Apache installation. This installation method will also
not work on Windows.

When installing mod_wsgi using this method, except that you will install
the ``mod_wsgi-standalone`` package instead of the ``mod_wsgi`` package,
you should follow installation and usage instructions outlined on the
PyPi page for the ``mod_wsgi`` package.
